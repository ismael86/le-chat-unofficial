Mistral doesn't official supply an app and the website works just fine. I have the tendancy to lose a tab or forget where a tab is located and prefer an app for that reason.

#### Prerequisites in order to build and package the app
Make sure you have node.js installed

#### Install the required node modules
`npm install`

#### Start / test the app
`npm start`

#### Package the app depending on your platform
`npm run package-mac`

`npm run package-win`

`npm run package-linux`

You'll find the binaries in the dist subfolder
